                <h3>What is Data Structures</h3>
                <p>
                    Data Structure can be defined as the group of data elements which provides an efficient way of storing and organising data in the computer so that it can be used efficiently. Some examples of Data Structures are arrays, Linked List, Stack, Queue, etc. Data Structures are widely used in almost every aspect of Computer Science i.e. Operating System, Compiler Design, Artifical intelligence, Graphics and many more.<br><br>
                    Data Structures are the main part of many computer science algorithms as they enable the programmers to handle the data in an efficient way. It plays a vital role in enhancing the performance of a software or a program as the main function of the software is to store and retrieve the user's data as fast as possible.

                <h3>Major Operations</h3>
                <P>The major or the common operations that can be performed on the data structures are:
                    <ul type="disc" >
                        <li>Searching: We can search for any element in a data structure.</li><br>
                        <li>Insertion: We can also insert the new element in a data structure.</li><br>
                        <li>Updation: We can also update the element, i.e., we can replace the element with another element.</li><br>
                        <li>Deletion: We can also perform the delete operation to remove the element from the data structure</li>
                    </ul>
                </P>

                <h3>Advantages of Data Structures</h3>
                <p>
                    <ul type="disc" >
                        <li>Efficiency: Efficiency of a program depends upon the choice of data structures. For example: suppose, we have some data and we need to perform the search for a perticular record.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>Reusability: Data structures are reusable, i.e. once we have implemented a particular data structure, we can use it at any other place. Implementation of data structures can be compiled into libraries which can be used by different clients. </li><br>
                        <li>Abstraction: Data structure is specified by the ADT which provides a level of abstraction. The client program uses the data structure through interface only, without getting into the implementation details. </li>
                        
                        
                    </ul>

                <h3>Data Structure Classification</h3>

                    <ul type="disc" >
                        <li>Primitive data structure</li><br>
                        The primitive data structures are primitive data types. The int, char, float, double, and pointer are the primitive data structures that can hold a single value.<br><br>
                        <li>Non-primitive data structure</li><br>
                            <ul type="disc" >

                <h3>What is an Algorithm?</h3>
                <p >
                    An algorithm is a process or a set of rules required to perform calculations or some other problem-solving operations especially by a computer. The formal definition of an algorithm is that it contains the finite set of instructions which are being carried in a specific order to perform the specific task. It is not the complete program or code; it is just a solution (logic) of a problem, which can be represented either as an informal description using a Flowchart or Pseudocode.

                <h3>Characteristics of an Algorithm</h3>
                <p>
                    <ul type="disc" >
                        <li>Input: An algorithm has some input values. We can pass 0 or some input value to an algorithm.</li><br>
                        <li>Output: We will get 1 or more output at the end of an algorithm.</li><br>
                        <li>Unambiguity: An algorithm should be unambiguous which means that the instructions in an algorithm should be clear and simple.</li><br>
                        <li>Effectiveness: An algorithm should be effective as each instruction in an algorithm affects the overall process.</li><br>
                        <li>Language independent: An algorithm must be language-independent so that the instructions in an algorithm can be implemented in any of the languages with the same output.</li>

                <h3>Why do we need Algorithms?</h3>
                <p>
                    <ul type="disc" >
                        <li>Scalability: It helps us to understand the scalability. When we have a big real-world problem, we need to scale it down into small-small steps to easily analyze the problem.</li><br>
                        <li>Performance: The real-world is not easily broken down into smaller steps. If the problem can be easily broken into smaller steps means that the problem is feasible.</li>
