                <h3>What is HTML</h3>
                <p>
                    HTML is an acronym which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which is used for creating web pages and web applications. Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page.
                    <ul type="disc" >
                        <li>Hyper Text: HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within it, is a hypertext. Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other. </li>Markup language: A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout and formatting conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into images, tables, links, etc.<br>

                <p>
                    An HTML document consist of its basic building blocks which are:
                    <ul type="disc" >
                        <li>Tags: An HTML tag surrounds the content and apply meaning to it. It is written between  and angular  brackets.</li><br>
                        <li>Attribute: An attribute in HTML provides extra information about the element, and it is applied within the start tag. An HTML attribute contains two fields: name & value.</li><br>
                       <li>Elements: An HTML element is an individual component of an HTML file. In an HTML file, everything written within tags are termed as HTML elements.</li>
                        
                    </ul>

            </div>
           
            <div class="box1">
                <img src="project_image/35.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <img src="project_image/textbox7.jpg" alt="">
            
                <h3>HTML Attribute</h3>
                <p> 
                    <ul type="disc" >

                        <li>Each element or tag can have attributes, which defines the behaviour of that element. </li>Attributes should always be applied with start tag. <br>
                        <li> The Attribute should always be applied with its name and value pair. </li><br>
                        <li>The Attributes name and values are case sensitive, and it is recommended by W3C that it should be written in Lowercase only. </li><br>
