                <p >
                    Artificial intelligence has the potential to transform all organizations. The process by which this transformation happens can vary, but the steps will tend to follow the roadmap we have listed in this book. Following all the steps outlined in the previous chapters will enable your organization to implement and excel in the use of AI technology. AI holds the key to unlocking a magnificent future where, driven by data and computers that understand our world, we will all make more informed decisions. These computers of the future will understand not just how to turn on the switches but why the switches need to be turned on. Even further, they may one day ask us if we need switches at all.
