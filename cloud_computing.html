                <h3>What is Cloud Computing</h3>
                <p>
                    The term cloud refers to a network or the internet. It is a technology that uses remote servers on the internet to store, manage, and access data online rather than local drives. The data can be anything such as files, images, documents, audio, video, and more.<br>There are the following operations that we can do using cloud computing:
                    <ul type="disc" >
                        <li>Developing new applications and services</li>
                        <li>Storage, back up, and recovery of data</li>
                        <li>Hosting blogs and websites</li>
                        <li>Delivery of software on demand</li>
                        <li>Streaming videos and audios</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Why Cloud Computing?</h3>
                <P>
                    Small as well as large IT companies, follow the traditional methods to provide the IT infrastructure. That means for any IT company, we need a Server Room that is the basic need of IT companies.<br>

                    In that server room, there should be a database server, mail server, networking, firewalls, routers, modem, switches, QPS (Query Per Second means how much queries or load will be handled by the server), configurable system, high net speed, and the maintenance engineers.<br>

                    To establish such IT infrastructure, we need to spend lots of money. To overcome all these problems and to reduce the IT infrastructure cost, Cloud Computing comes into existence.
                    
                </P>
