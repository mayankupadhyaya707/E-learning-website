                <h3>Introduction to DAA Algorithm</h3>
                <p>
                    An algorithm can be defined as a finite set of steps, which has to be followed while carrying out a particular problem. It is nothing but a process of executing actions step by step.<br><br>

An algorithm is a distinct computational procedure that takes input as a set of values and results in the output as a set of values by solving the problem. More precisely, an algorithm is correct, if, for each input instance, it gets the correct output and gets terminated.<br><br>

An algorithm unravels the computational problems to output the desired result. An algorithm can be described by incorporating a natural language such as English, Computer language, or a hardware language.

                <h3>Complexity of Algorithm</h3>
                <p>The term algorithm complexity measures how many steps are required by the algorithm to solve the given problem. It evaluates the order of count of operations executed by an algorithm as a function of input data size.<BR><BR>

                    To assess the complexity, the order (approximation) of the count of operation is always considered instead of counting the exact steps.<BR>
                    
                    O(f) notation represents the complexity of an algorithm, which is also termed as an Asymptotic notation or "Big O" notation. Here the f corresponds to the function whose size is the same as that of the input data. The complexity of the asymptotic computation O(f) determines in which order the resources such as CPU
                    time, memory, etc. are consumed by the algorithm that is articulated as a function of the size of the input data.

                <h3>Asymptotic Analysis of algorithms</h3>
                <p >
                    The word Asymptotic means approaching a value or curve arbitrarily closely (i.e., as some sort of limit is taken).<BR><BR>
                        Resources for an algorithm are usually expressed as a function regarding input. Often this function is messy and complicated to work. To study Function growth efficiently, we reduce the function down to the important part.<BR><BR>
                            It is a technique of representing limiting behavior. The methodology has the applications across science. It can be used to analyze the performance of an algorithm for some large data set.

                <h3>Asymptotic Notations</h3>
                <p>
                    

Asymptotic Notation is a way of comparing function that ignores constant factors and small input sizes. Three notations are used to calculate the running time complexity of an algorithm:
                    <ul type="disc" >
                        <li>Big-oh notation: Big-oh is the formal method of expressing the upper bound of an algorithm's running time. It is the measure of the longest amount of time. The function f (n) = O (g (n)) [read as "f of n is big-oh of g of n"] if and only if exist positive constant c and such that

                            f (n) ⩽ k.g (n)f(n)⩽k.g(n) for n>n0n>n0 in all case   </li><br>
                        <li> Omega () Notation: The function f (n) = Ω (g (n)) [read as "f of n is omega of g of n"] if and only if there exists positive constant c and n0 such that

                            F (n) ≥ k* g (n) for all n, n≥ n0
                            </li><br>
