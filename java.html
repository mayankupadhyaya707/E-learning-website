                <h3>What is Java</h3>
                <p>
                    Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.<BR><BR>

                    Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995. James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.

                        <li>Platform: Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform</li><br>

                <h3>First Java Program | Hello World</h3>
                <P>
                    To create a simple Java program, you need to create a class that contains the main method. Let's understand the requirement first.
                   <br><BR>
                    For executing any Java program, the following software or application must be properly installed.
                        <ul type="disc" >
                            <li>Install the JDK if you don't have installed it, download the JDK
                                and install it.</li><br>
                            <li>Set path of the jdk/bin directory</li><br>
                            <li>Create the Java program</li><br>
                            <li>Compile and run the Java program</li><BR>
                            <LI> class Simple{  
                                    public static void main(String args[]){  
                                     System.out.println("Hello Java");  
                                    }  
                                }</LI>
                        </ul>

                <h3>Java Variables</h3>
                <p>
                    A variable is a container which holds the value while the Java program
is executed. A variable is assigned with a data type.<BR>

Variable is a name of memory location. There are three types of variables in java: local, instance and static.
                    <ul type="disc" >
                        <li>Local Variable: A variable declared inside the body of the method is called local variable. You can use this variable only within that method and the other methods in the class aren't even aware that the variable exists.
                            
                            A local variable cannot be defined with "static" keyword.</li><br>
                        <li> Instance Variable :A variable declared inside the class but outside the body of the method, is called an instance variable. It is not declared as static
                            .
                            
                            It is called an instance variable because its value is instance-specific and is not shared among instances.</li><br>
                        <li>Static variable

                            A variable that is declared as static is called a static variable. It cannot be local. You can create a single copy of the static variable and share it among all the instances of the class. Memory allocation for static variables happens only once when the class is loaded in the memory.</li><br>
                    
                        
                    </ul>

                <h3>Operators in Java</h3>
                <p>
                    Operator in Java is a symbol that is used to perform operations. For example: +, -, *, / etc.<BR>

There are many types of operators in Java which are given below:
                    <ul type="disc" >
                        <li>
                            Unary Operator,</li><BR>
                       <LI> Assignment Operator.</li><br>
                        <li> Arithmetic Operator</li><br>
                        <li> Shift Operator</li><br>
                        <li>Relational Operator</li><br>
                        <li>Bitwise Operator</li><br>
                        <lI>Logical Operator</li><br>
                        <li> Ternary Operator </li><br>
